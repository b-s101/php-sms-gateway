php-sms-gateway
===============

The webservice part of a SMS gateway based on gammu.

There are several documentation in the 'doc' folder. Documentation is not finished yet
but I'm on a good way.

I'd highly appreciate any contributions. If you want to take part in developing just
drop an email to smsgateway@bs101.de.

You may also check my blog over at http://www.bs101.de for anything related to this project.
Don't wonder about the blog being in german - everthing related to this project will
be written in english.
